                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                      Muscular strength—the maximum force a muscle can exert in a single contraction—is vital for both daily tasks and athletic performance (DeBusk, 2020). Factors such as muscle size, fiber composition, and neural activation affect strength development. Building muscular strength improves posture, aids in maintaining a healthy body weight, and reduces the risk of chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Beyond physical benefits, it also supports mental health by boosting endorphin release, reducing stress, and lowering symptoms of depression (Robinson et al., 2024b; American Psychiatric Association, 2024).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To develop muscular strength, resistance training is recommended 2–3 times a week using weights, bodyweight movements, or resistance bands. Coupled with proper rest and nutrition—especially adequate protein intake—this promotes muscle growth and recovery (Robson, 2021). Around 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily supports muscle protein synthesis (DeSoto, 2022), though even slight increases can yield benefits (Tagawa et al., 2022). Progressive overload, which involves gradually increasing training stress, is key to continuous improvement (Plotkin, 2022).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Low strength can result from aging, inactivity, or poor nutrition. Age-related muscle loss, especially in those over 30, accelerates with time (De Maio Nascimento et al., 2022; Cleveland Clinic, 2024). Inactivity during youth reduces muscle volume and neuromuscular efficiency (Wang et al., 2021). Additionally, low muscular strength is linked to higher risks of mortality and chronic diseases (Duchowny, 2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Body insecurities, particularly among college students and young adults, can worsen mental health and discourage physical activity. Body dysmorphic disorder affects about 4.4% of students and often coexists with anxiety and depression (BBD Foundation, 2021; Mental Health America, 2024).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Many individuals also face financial constraints that limit gym access and healthy food choices (Armstrong et al., 2018). Therefore, this advocacy promotes home-based strength training that is accessible, cost-efficient, and guided by science-backed methods. It empowers youth and low-income individuals to build strength safely and effectively from home.

                    <h2>Formulated Program</h2>
                    
                    <section className="approach-methods">
                      <h3>Approach/Methods</h3>
                      
                      <h4>Dietary-based Strategies</h4>
                      <p>
                        Meal plans designed for muscle gain emphasize a high intake of protein, vitamins, minerals, and calories for proper muscle synthesis. Daily foods should include protein sources in each meal and snack every week. It's crucial to focus on nutrient-dense foods rather than empty calories (Jaspan, 2024). In addition to whole foods, certain supplements can enhance muscle gain outcomes. These may include protein powders, creatine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) to support recovery and performance (Wirth, 2024).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For an efficient approach in proper nutrition, food logging is crucial. A food log is an essential tool for anyone looking to increase muscle mass effectively. By tracking food intake, individuals can ensure they are meeting their nutritional goals regarding macronutrients, which are vital for muscle growth and recovery. Modern technology allows for easier logging through food tracking apps that can calculate macronutrients automatically.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Activity-based Strategies</h4>
                      <p>
                        A home-based workout routine provides an accessible, economical, and effective method for maintaining physical fitness without the need for specialized equipment or access to a gym. By utilizing bodyweight exercises, individuals can engage in strength-building activities while simultaneously improving flexibility and cardiovascular endurance. These exercises effectively target major muscle groups and can be tailored to suit both beginners and more experienced individuals.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Promotion-based Strategies</h4>
                      <p>
                        The methodology of this exercise routine shall be contained in an ebook format. The ebook shall contain factual information about muscle-building, including formulated routines and nutritional intake. Fitness results shall be posted on story or on feed via Instagram and Facebook. In each story, the link to the ebook shall be attached for faster dissemination. One should also use the #NoGymNoProblem to promote engagement and reach.
                      </p>
