          <h4>Intermittent Fasting Schedule</h4>
          <p>
            I currently practice intermittent fasting using the 16:8 method, where I fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour windowâ€”typically from 12 PM to 8 PM. I've found this routine helps me manage my appetite, stay consistent with my nutrition, and maintain better energy levels throughout the day. I also appreciate the simplicity it brings to my schedule. I'd like to continue following this approach, but I'm open to adjusting it if you think it might impact my training performance, recovery, or overall progress.
